My best guess currently is that goroutine slept for 20 seconds. To reproduce it I wrote the following:

And since these entities are read really often, there was a Redis-based cache in front of DB. After updating the entity in DB it was updated in the cache. And to be safe the whole process was under Redsic-based lock. So:
Lock for the entity is taken in Redis Entity is updated in DB Entity is updated in Redis Lost is released in Redis Everything is good and data is consistent everywhere, but this process is too long.</description></item><item><title>Profiling Java CPU and RAM with Mission Control</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jmc-profiling-cpu-and-memory/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 16:34:58 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jmc-profiling-cpu-and-memory/</guid><description>Some time ago I was a lecturer on Java courses and wanted to craft a sample for profiling Java applications. Currently, we have plenty of profilers, and more than that - many of them are completely free to use. One of them is Java Mission Control. It was a commercial offering with a limited free version, but now it is completely free and open-sourced. It was required to buy it to use in production back in the days and this alone should give a hint, that this profiler is so lightweight that it can be used in production.</description></item><item><title>Using map[]struct{} or map[]bool in Golang</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/map-bool-or-struct/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 13:35:52 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/map-bool-or-struct/</guid><description>In Golang you do not have set data structure. So you can use map instead. When you do not need values there are two options widely used - using empty struct{} or bool as value. struct{} should be more performant, while bool is more convinient. I decided to check the first promise myslef. Golang have benchamrks support in its standard library. SO I wrote this one:

Major part of my career to the moment passed working with databases and mostly with Oracle and Postgres. Several years ago I was really surprised by the difference in handling CTE (common table expressions) in these databases. From that time I spread this knowledge and recreated a sample for it several times. The last one was this week and I decided to store it somewhere - this mostly dead blog seems like a good place ;-) So here is a really simple case of using CTE on Oracle.</description></item><item><title>Benchmarking an interview question</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/benchmarking-add-exact/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2015 23:22:39 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/benchmarking-add-exact/</guid><description>Author benchmarks a super-simple method with a dumb implementation from his recent job interview. Results of this benchmark contradict with assumptions. The process of benchmarking produces some public benefit.
So, on a recent job interview it was suggested to write implementation for a really simple method
public int sum(int x, int y); The main question for implementation is surely dealing with integer overflow (we were speaking about Java programming language). As it was left for me to decide what to do in case of overflow I suggested a standard way - throwing exception.</description></item><item><title>Learning Vaadin7 Review</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/learning-vaadin7-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2013 17:42:46 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/learning-vaadin7-review/</guid><description>Some time ago I was proposed to review the second edition of the &amp;ldquo;Learning Vaadin 7&amp;rdquo; (On Amazon) book. Shame on me for holding it for so long. Previously I have used Vaadin 6 and was really impressed by its features and simplicity of doing real desktop-like web-applications. But at the same time every now and then I was frustrated by some of the methods and mostly by the methods returning plain Objects.</description></item><item><title>Github vs Bitbucket</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/github-vs-bitbucket/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2013 09:30:30 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/github-vs-bitbucket/</guid><description>Github totally owns the open-source movement today. And this situation impacts enterprise development. But as far as I can tell Bitbucket is much better for proprietary development in private repositories. Here are the arguments:
Option to prevent non-fast-forward pushes. It even allows to prevent non-fast-forward and still allowing removal of feature-branches! As far as I know, this may require a bit of configuration in standalone git repositories. No such option on Github.</description></item><item><title>Use newer Java FTW!</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/use-newer-java-ftw/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 09:44:46 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/use-newer-java-ftw/</guid><description>One of my recent tasks was trying to convince client, that we should target the 7th version of the JVM, and not the 5th.

What Java implementation are we going to use? The most used one is Oracle. Oracle Java5 reached its official end of life in Oct 2009 Oracle Java6 reached its official end of life in Feb 2013 (there will be no public updates anymore, nor any security updates)</description></item><item><title>Order of Enums in Hashmap</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/order-of-enums-in-hashmap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2012 09:50:33 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/order-of-enums-in-hashmap/</guid><description>Recently I have found myself writing a complex sql-builder for two weeks already. Of cause I used TDD technique and this was much less like a pain comparing to the times when I didn&amp;rsquo;t wrote any tests.

In the resulting type hierarchy there were some enums.</description></item><item><title>ForkJoin factorial</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/forkjoin-factorial/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2011 10:05:54 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/forkjoin-factorial/</guid><description>Several months ago I wrote a multithreaded factorial method. It was very simple from the point of view of the underlying technology, but not so trivial from the point of view of synchronizing threads. It used simple start() and join() methods that are available since the Java 1.0 And than I thought that with all the power of java I can improve it. So i used the ThreadPoolExecutor - a piece of technology from the Java 5 and really improved - here is my post about multithreaded factorial using TreadPoolExecutor.</description></item><item><title>Multithreaded factorial with ThreadPoolExecutor</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial-with-threadpoolexecutor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2011 10:00:17 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial-with-threadpoolexecutor/</guid><description>Update: the follow up post gives another version using newly introduced API.
In the previous post I have written a multithreaded factorial. It was not really good, because last one of the worker threads worked significantly longer than the first one. Fortunately we are living in 2011 and Java 1.5 was released so long time ago. The solution is simple - do not create 4 threads of the 4 virtual cores processors.</description></item><item><title>Multithreaded factorial</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2011 09:55:51 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial/</guid><description>Update: the follow up post gives another version, that lacks the drawback of unequal load on processor cores.
There is a very good blog post about how to write the factorial method in Java (really it is not about righting factorial). However, even in this master peace;-) there is no multi-threaded factorial. So here it is. There are some problems with it. The most significant is that multiplying all the BigIntegers from 1 to 50000 is much less heavy job for the computer, than multiplying all BigIntegers from 50001 to 100000.</description></item><item><title>Not symmetric equals after override</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/not-symmetric-equals-after-override/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2011 10:23:54 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/not-symmetric-equals-after-override/</guid><description>There is really cool tool FindBugs and recently I found that it can discover (and discovered such a situation in my experience) broken symmetry for equals method when overriding it.

It is not a little number, but in modern systems there could be definitely much more objects.
In a very good book by Joshua Bloch I have read that there is a probability that two consequently created objects will have an equal system identity hashcode. Actually from the time of publishing that book major version of Java was released and the situation has improved dramatically.</description></item></channel></rss>
