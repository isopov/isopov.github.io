Shame on me for holding it for so long. Previously I have used Vaadin 6 and was really impressed by its features and simplicity of doing real desktop-like web-applications. But at the same time every now and then I was frustrated by some of the methods and mostly by the methods returning plain Objects. Fortunately now these type-safety problems are solved with the Vaadin 7.
But what about the book? It seems as really good introduction to Vaadin for junior developers:</p><ul><li>It has a really extensive and balanced introduction that defines Vaadin place in the Java and Web ecosystems. Actually, I think that it is worth reading on its own.</li><li>It proceeds with detailed instructions on the development environment setup with a dive into production setup.</li><li>It is really detailed with all the basic and not so basic concepts of building Vaadin applications clearly explained.</li></ul><p>The drawbacks of the book, that I can name are:</p><ul><li>Examples use ant+ivy as a build system that seems less widespread to me, but it may have its benefits since it leaves much less area for &ldquo;build magic&rdquo; and gives more control and understanding of the build. Also information about Maven is given in a separate chapter.</li><li>Book seems like a one time reading for me. It can not be used as reference - but again, it is clearly stated that this is not a goal. Also it will motivate readers to search for information as it should be done after the book is read.</li></ul><p>As an overall conclusion, I would not buy such book for myself, but I will probably recommend it to newbie developers.</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©
