        <p>Some time ago I was a lecturer on Java courses and wanted to craft a sample for profiling Java applications. Currently we have a plenty of profilers and more then that - many of them are completely free to use. One of them is <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jmc/">Java Mission Control</a>. It was a commercial offering with limited free version, but now it is completely free and open sourced. It was required to buy it to use in production back in the days and this alone should give a hint, that this profiler is so lightweight that it can be used in production. Now you can download builds of JMC from different vendoers. I downloaded one from <a href="https://www.azul.com/products/zulu-mission-control/">Azul</a>.</p>
<p>But lets dive into code. First of all I wanted to provide a sample to profile CPU-bounded algorithm. And I wrote this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.math.BigInteger;

@RestController
public class CpuController {

    @GetMapping(&#34;/factorial/{num}&#34;)
    public Double burn(@PathVariable int num) {
        var result = BigInteger.ONE;
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= num; i++) {
            result = result.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(i));
        }
        return result.doubleValue();
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>What can be more CPU-intensive than crunching numbers? I started mission control flight recording with default settings and started updated the page <code>http://localhost:8080/factorial/100000</code>. Factorial for 100_000 is to large to be represented as double and I got <code>&quot;Infinity&quot;</code> all the time, but this computation lasted for several seconds every time, so there were more computation, then waiting for me requesting it one more time.</p>
<p>Right on the first page of flight recording result there is the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The program allocated 95.2 % of the memory outside of TLABs.
Allocating objects outside of Thread Local Allocation Buffers (TLABs) is more expensive than allocating inside TLABs. This may be acceptable if the individual allocations are intended to be larger than a reasonable TLAB. It may be possible to avoid this by decreasing the size of the individual allocations. There are some TLAB related JVM flags that you can experiment with, but it is usually better to let the JVM manage TLAB sizes automatically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Memory section I found that it was allocated more than 200GB of <code>int[]</code> arrays. That alone (and there were other allocations as well - 1.8GB of <code>BigInteger</code> objects among others) stand for more than 3 GB/s. And since these allocations were expensive outside TLABs (thread local allocation buffers - allocating inside them is basically one internal memory inceremnt most of the times) this is very close be the bottleneck of the algorithm.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a CPU-bound programm but unintentionally made RAM-bound one. Profiling results were unexpected but really good sample that our assumptions do not always hold true.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, let&rsquo;s profile another algorithm, that was originally ment to be RAM-bound. Here it is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;

@RestController
public class MemoryLoadController {

    @GetMapping(&#34;/allocate/{mbs}&#34;)
    public int allocate(@PathVariable int mbs) {
        final var random = ThreadLocalRandom.current();
        var dummyresult = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; mbs; i++) {
            final byte[] mb = new byte[1024 * 1024];
            random.nextBytes(mb);
            dummyresult += sum(mb);
        }
        return dummyresult;
    }

    private static int sum(byte[] bytes) {
        var result = 0;
        for (byte b : bytes) {
            result += b;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>It should be memory bound, since it is doing almost only allocations. However JVM has good just-in-time compiler (JIT) with good dead code elimination (DCE) and we must be sure, that our allocations will actually happen. For that reason I fill them with garbage. If we are lucky enough pre-zeroing of allocated arrays will be eliminated by the JIT. But to not get our garbage eliminated also lets make a checksum of it and return to the caller.</p>
<p>So I fired several requests to <code>http://localhost:8080/allocate/10000</code>. Moreover, to fully load allocator I fired these requests concurrently. I have RAM with two channels after all. So during 1 minute flight recording even more memory should be allocated, than was with my &ldquo;CPU-bound&rdquo; algorithm. But! Actually without firing up profiler it should be clear that something is not going as expected, since running only one request to allocate 10_000 MBs takes several long seconds ANd profiler gives as overwhelming result that only 44 GBs of <code>byte[]</code> arrays were allocated during profiling session. That is less then 1 GB/s! Sure, modern machines can do better.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look into &ldquo;Method Profiling&rdquo; section. It has some unexpected results too. Most of the samples (7110) of this sampling profiler were caught in <code>java.util.Random.nextBytes(byte[])</code> method. That is my &ldquo;filing with garbage&rdquo; that ought to be very cheap and only serve the purpose of not eliminating allocation alltogether. The second method that caught most of samples is <code>MemoryLoadController.sum(byte[])</code> - 1696. The third is what I wanted to be the leader - <code>MemoryLoadController.allocate(int)</code> method itself, not counting any method calls inside it. That should be actual memory allocation.</p>
<p>It turns out that my second algorithm is not RAM-bound, but rather CPU-bound. That is another sample of our assumptions contradicting with reality. But is it good, since in the end I have two samples - one CPU-bound and one RAM-bound. Just that I have mistaken which one is which.</p>
