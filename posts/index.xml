Lightweight transaction is started that is not really compatible with running some data modification queries without such clause. I debugged this problem to the simple independent reproducer, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to share it.

There was some measurable overhead, but it was mild. However in order for another goroutine to recieve some work to be done or/and to publish work results you may need go channel also. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll try to measure the overhead of contended access to go channel.

You can execute any code inside them and this caode can allocate as much as needed. Both on stack and on heap. If goroutine stack is too small it grows. This grow is not free. Suppose you have a widely used function that needs to allocate a bit of memory on stack.</description></item><item><title>Go sync.Pool contention</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/sync-pool-contention/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2023 16:22:39 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/sync-pool-contention/</guid><description>Recently my colleague suggested that contention on a single sync.Pool in Go may hit performance. I decided to reproduce this performance hit in a benchmark. This is what I was capable of writing.

However despite the fact that difference between Loom and platform threads was clearly visible, Loom was even better. Total execution time was equal (or should be even better for Loom). But also there was some visible gradual progress.
However it is possible to get into situation where Loom virtual threads will behave worse than the platform threads. This situation is a pretty common pattern and it is called noisy neighbor problem.</description></item><item><title>Java Cryptography Extension Providers Performance</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jce-benchmarks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2022 20:44:46 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jce-benchmarks/</guid><description>The Java Cryptography Extensions exist for many years, They allow to use cryptography that is not bundled in the Java platform itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve met Bouncycastle crypto provider library many times in projects I worked on. But there are other third party crypto providers as well.

However, reading about it guides that it may be hard to use tool. And sometimes it can degrade for third-party reasons. It is easy to trap into old information regarding sync.Pool and gc interrogation. Since go 1.13 sync.Pool is not cleared completely on every gc. However, it is still affected by gc. Suppose the following code:
type Obj []int func (o *Obj) Fill() { for i := 0; i &amp;lt; cap(*o); i++ { *o = append(*o, i) } } func (o Obj) Count() int { result := 0 for i := 0; i &amp;lt; len(o); i++ { result += o[i] } return result } func NewObj() *Obj { o := make(Obj, 0, 100*1024) return &amp;amp;o } var objPool = &amp;amp;sync.</description></item><item><title>Go sync.Pool</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/go-sync-pool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Feb 2022 13:30:49 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/go-sync-pool/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve seen sync.Pools in various Go libraries.

And since these entities are read really often, there was a Redis-based cache in front of DB. After updating the entity in DB it was updated in the cache. And to be safe the whole process was under Redsic-based lock. So:
Lock for the entity is taken in Redis Entity is updated in DB Entity is updated in Redis Lost is released in Redis Everything is good and data is consistent everywhere, but this process is too long.</description></item><item><title>Profiling Java CPU and RAM with Mission Control</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jmc-profiling-cpu-and-memory/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 16:34:58 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jmc-profiling-cpu-and-memory/</guid><description>Some time ago I was a lecturer on Java courses and wanted to craft a sample for profiling Java applications.

Major part of my career to the moment passed working with databases and mostly with Oracle and Postgres. Several years ago I was really surprised by the difference in handling CTE (common table expressions) in these databases. From that time I spread this knowledge and recreated a sample for it several times. The last one was this week and I decided to store it somewhere - this mostly dead blog seems like a good place ;-) So here is a really simple case of using CTE on Oracle.</description></item><item><title>Benchmarking an interview question</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/benchmarking-add-exact/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2015 23:22:39 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/benchmarking-add-exact/</guid><description>Author benchmarks a super-simple method with a dumb implementation from his recent job interview. Results of this benchmark contradict with assumptions. The process of benchmarking produces some public benefit.
So, on a recent job interview it was suggested to write implementation for a really simple method
public int sum(int x, int y); The main question for implementation is surely dealing with integer overflow (we were speaking about Java programming language). As it was left for me to decide what to do in case of overflow I suggested a standard way - throwing exception.</description></item><item><title>Learning Vaadin7 Review</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/learning-vaadin7-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2013 17:42:46 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/learning-vaadin7-review/</guid><description>Some time ago I was proposed to review the second edition of the &amp;ldquo;Learning Vaadin 7&amp;rdquo; (On Amazon) book.

Option to prevent non-fast-forward pushes. It even allows to prevent non-fast-forward and still allowing removal of feature-branches! As far as I know, this may require a bit of configuration in standalone git repositories. No such option on Github.</description></item><item><title>Use newer Java FTW!</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/use-newer-java-ftw/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 09:44:46 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/use-newer-java-ftw/</guid><description>One of my recent tasks was trying to convince client, that we should target the 7th version of the JVM, and not the 5th.

It was very simple from the point of view of the underlying technology, but not so trivial from the point of view of synchronizing threads. It used simple start() and join() methods that are available since the Java 1.0 And than I thought that with all the power of java I can improve it. So i used the ThreadPoolExecutor - a piece of technology from the Java 5 and really improved - here is my post about multithreaded factorial using TreadPoolExecutor.</description></item><item><title>Multithreaded factorial with ThreadPoolExecutor</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial-with-threadpoolexecutor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2011 10:00:17 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial-with-threadpoolexecutor/</guid><description>Update: the follow up post gives another version using newly introduced API.
In the previous post I have written a multithreaded factorial. It was not really good, because last one of the worker threads worked significantly longer than the first one. Fortunately we are living in 2011 and Java 1.5 was released so long time ago. The solution is simple - do not create 4 threads of the 4 virtual cores processors.</description></item><item><title>Multithreaded factorial</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2011 09:55:51 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial/</guid><description>Update: the follow up post gives another version, that lacks the drawback of unequal load on processor cores.
There is a very good blog post about how to write the factorial method in Java (really it is not about righting factorial). However, even in this master peace;-) there is no multi-threaded factorial. So here it is. There are some problems with it. The most significant is that multiplying all the BigIntegers from 1 to 50000 is much less heavy job for the computer, than multiplying all BigIntegers from 50001 to 100000.</description></item><item><title>Not symmetric equals after override</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/not-symmetric-equals-after-override/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2011 10:23:54 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/not-symmetric-equals-after-override/</guid><description>There is really cool tool FindBugs and recently I found that it can discover (and discovered such a situation in my experience) broken symmetry for equals method when overriding it.
