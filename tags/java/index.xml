Lightweight transaction is started that is not really compatible with running some data modification queries without such clause. I debugged this problem to the simple independent reproducer, so I&amp;rsquo;d like to share it.

However despite the fact that difference between Loom and platform threads was clearly visible, Loom was even better. Total execution time was equal (or should be even better for Loom). But also there was some visible gradual progress.
However it is possible to get into situation where Loom virtual threads will behave worse than the platform threads. This situation is a pretty common pattern and it is called noisy neighbor problem.</description></item><item><title>Java Cryptography Extension Providers Performance</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jce-benchmarks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 May 2022 20:44:46 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jce-benchmarks/</guid><description>The Java Cryptography Extensions exist for many years, They allow to use cryptography that is not bundled in the Java platform itself. I&amp;rsquo;ve met Bouncycastle crypto provider library many times in projects I worked on. But there are other third party crypto providers as well. At least two of them - Consrypt and Corretto (named the same way as Openjdk distribution by Amazon) declare high performance as their features. I decided to measure these claims and wrote some benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Updating value in cache or simply invalidate it instead</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/cache-update-or-invalidate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 10:51:48 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/cache-update-or-invalidate/</guid><description>Recently I worked on a process of updating many entities in DB. And since these entities are read really often, there was a Redis-based cache in front of DB. After updating the entity in DB it was updated in the cache. And to be safe the whole process was under Redsic-based lock. So:
Lock for the entity is taken in Redis Entity is updated in DB Entity is updated in Redis Lost is released in Redis Everything is good and data is consistent everywhere, but this process is too long.</description></item><item><title>Profiling Java CPU and RAM with Mission Control</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jmc-profiling-cpu-and-memory/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 16:34:58 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/jmc-profiling-cpu-and-memory/</guid><description>Some time ago I was a lecturer on Java courses and wanted to craft a sample for profiling Java applications. Currently, we have plenty of profilers, and more than that - many of them are completely free to use. One of them is Java Mission Control. It was a commercial offering with a limited free version, but now it is completely free and open-sourced. It was required to buy it to use in production back in the days and this alone should give a hint, that this profiler is so lightweight that it can be used in production.</description></item><item><title>Learning Vaadin7 Review</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/learning-vaadin7-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Dec 2013 17:42:46 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/learning-vaadin7-review/</guid><description>Some time ago I was proposed to review the second edition of the &amp;ldquo;Learning Vaadin 7&amp;rdquo; (On Amazon) book. Shame on me for holding it for so long. Previously I have used Vaadin 6 and was really impressed by its features and simplicity of doing real desktop-like web-applications. But at the same time every now and then I was frustrated by some of the methods and mostly by the methods returning plain Objects.</description></item><item><title>Use newer Java FTW!</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/use-newer-java-ftw/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 09:44:46 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/use-newer-java-ftw/</guid><description>One of my recent tasks was trying to convince client, that we should target the 7th version of the JVM, and not the 5th. I failed. Actually I don&amp;rsquo;t think that such task is possible unless there are no any real reasons in using older Java. Nevertheless here is the text, that I wrote.
What Java implementation are we going to use? The most used one is Oracle. Oracle Java5 reached its official end of life in Oct 2009 Oracle Java6 reached its official end of life in Feb 2013 (there will be no public updates anymore, nor any security updates)</description></item><item><title>Order of Enums in Hashmap</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/order-of-enums-in-hashmap/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2012 09:50:33 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/order-of-enums-in-hashmap/</guid><description>Recently I have found myself writing a complex sql-builder for two weeks already. Of cause I used TDD technique and this was much less like a pain comparing to the times when I didn&amp;rsquo;t wrote any tests. In some moment I decided that just operating with strings in some thousand or more lines of code is not very cool and started to write some OOD for the problem. In the resulting type hierarchy there were some enums.</description></item><item><title>ForkJoin factorial</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/forkjoin-factorial/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2011 10:05:54 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/forkjoin-factorial/</guid><description>Several months ago I wrote a multithreaded factorial method. It was very simple from the point of view of the underlying technology, but not so trivial from the point of view of synchronizing threads. It used simple start() and join() methods that are available since the Java 1.0 And than I thought that with all the power of java I can improve it. So i used the ThreadPoolExecutor - a piece of technology from the Java 5 and really improved - here is my post about multithreaded factorial using TreadPoolExecutor.</description></item><item><title>Multithreaded factorial with ThreadPoolExecutor</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial-with-threadpoolexecutor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2011 10:00:17 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial-with-threadpoolexecutor/</guid><description>Update: the follow up post gives another version using newly introduced API.
In the previous post I have written a multithreaded factorial. It was not really good, because last one of the worker threads worked significantly longer than the first one. Fortunately we are living in 2011 and Java 1.5 was released so long time ago. The solution is simple - do not create 4 threads of the 4 virtual cores processors.</description></item><item><title>Multithreaded factorial</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2011 09:55:51 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/multithreaded-factorial/</guid><description>Update: the follow up post gives another version, that lacks the drawback of unequal load on processor cores.
There is a very good blog post about how to write the factorial method in Java (really it is not about righting factorial). However, even in this master peace;-) there is no multi-threaded factorial. So here it is. There are some problems with it. The most significant is that multiplying all the BigIntegers from 1 to 50000 is much less heavy job for the computer, than multiplying all BigIntegers from 50001 to 100000.</description></item><item><title>Not symmetric equals after override</title><link>https://isopov.github.io/posts/not-symmetric-equals-after-override/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Apr 2011 10:23:54 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://isopov.github.io/posts/not-symmetric-equals-after-override/</guid><description>There is really cool tool FindBugs and recently I found that it can discover (and discovered such a situation in my experience) broken symmetry for equals method when overriding it.

It is not a little number, but in modern systems there could be definitely much more objects.
In a very good book by Joshua Bloch I have read that there is a probability that two consequently created objects will have an equal system identity hashcode. Actually from the time of publishing that book major version of Java was released and the situation has improved dramatically.</description></item></channel></rss>
